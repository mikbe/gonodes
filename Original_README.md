Combinatorics is a fascinating branch of mathematics that every programmer should
have at least a working knowledge of. In this exercise, you'll research the
topic as a group, and then produce some code that serves as an interesting
example of what you learned.

This is primarily a research exercise, but in order to get credit for working on
it, each student is expected to produce working code that either does something
useful on its own or alternatively serves as a tool for other projects to use.

While working on this assignment, please keep the following guidelines in mind:

* You can research any area of combinatorics of interest to you, but in
  particular, you should look into graph theory because it is most directly
  applicable to programming problems and is fairly accessible without too much
  background information. In addition to the tremendous amount of information
  on wikipedia, there is a [free book on Graph
  Theory](http://code.google.com/p/graph-theory-algorithms-book/) that might 
  be a good place to start. 

* You should actively share resources with your fellow students in the session,
  as well as discuss your ideas and questions as they arise. This will make it
  possible to sift through the information much faster, and also help with
  figuring out what areas might be worth focusing on. The open-endedness of this
  exercise is intentional, so don't let it overwhelm you: Work together!

* Once you've gained a basic understanding of what combinatorics is about, you
  should think of either a program you can write that uses some combinatorial
  concepts, or think about building some library code that will make it easier
  for others to use combinatorial structures and algorithms in their own code.
  Be sure to include some practical examples no matter which approach you
  choose.
  
* Don't spend too much time on concepts that feel far outside of your reach, and
  similarly, don't worry about picking a very advanced concept to demonstrate in
  your programs. Instead, stick to the things that seem most fundamental, and
  work with us to figure out whether what you have in mind will be a good fit
  for this assignment. You can submit your project ideas via university-web for
  feedback at any time during the course, and it's recommended to do so before
  putting a lot of work into any particular idea.
